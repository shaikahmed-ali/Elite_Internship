## Dataset:
Since its initial identification in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the COVID-19 virus has had a significant impact on the world. While some individuals choose to focus on the positive changes that have emerged as a result of the pandemic, it is important to acknowledge the negative consequences that have occurred. From the economic and mental health impacts to other collateral damage, this period will likely be one of the most challenging that we will face in our lifetimes.
