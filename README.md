## About the Project

This project is a data analysis project using PySpark, focused on exploring and analyzing a dataset containing information about Disney movies. The dataset includes various attributes such as IMDb rating, runtime, genre, director, writer, actors, language, and more. The aim of this project is to gain insights from the data and answer relevant questions about Disney movies.

## Technologies Used

The project is built using the following technologies:
- PySpark: A fast and expressive distributed data processing engine for big data.
- Python: The primary programming language for writing PySpark jobs.

## Project Description

In this project, I utilize PySpark DataFrame API to analyze the Disney movie dataset. Perform various data exploration, transformation, and aggregation operations to derive valuable insights from the dataset.

The project demonstrates the use of PySpark for data analysis.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project contains information about Disney movies, including IMDb ratings, release year, genre, and more. The data is obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/.





# COVID-19 Analytical Dashboard
This is a [COVID-19 analytical dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNDQ5NzUzOTgtMzNiZC00MGVlLThkZTktOGU5NWJhZTg2YTRiIiwidCI6ImM5OWNlNTA0LTU3MDEtNGUwYS1iNDVjLWJiMzc0M2EyMmUyZCJ9) project that provides data and statistics related to the pandemic. The dashboard was built using Microsoft Power BI. 

## Dataset:
Since its initial identification in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the COVID-19 virus has had a significant impact on the world. While some individuals choose to focus on the positive changes that have emerged as a result of the pandemic, it is important to acknowledge the negative consequences that have occurred. From the economic and mental health impacts to other collateral damage, this period will likely be one of the most challenging that we will face in our lifetimes.

This [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/josephassaker/covid19-global-dataset) was obtained by Joseph Assaker and scraped from worldometers.info on May 14th, 2022. The data includes records from 225 countries, spanning from January 22nd, 2020 to May 14th, 2022.

## Features:
### The COVID-19 analytical dashboard provides the following features:

- Cumulative and daily statistics on confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
- Identification of the top 5 countries most impacted by COVID-19 on a given date.
- Interactive maps and charts that allow for visualization of the virus's spread across different regions.
- Comprehensive details about all impacted countries.
- Identification of the top 10 countries most impacted by COVID-19 during a specific month, ranked by the severity of the outbreak.



## Installation:
To run the COVID-19 analytical dashboard on your local machine, you will need to have Power BI Desktop installed. Clone this repository and open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop.
